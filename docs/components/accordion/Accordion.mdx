import { Accordion } from "technotic"

An accordion is the type of component that allows the user to expand and collapse sections of content to view or hide information as needed. This interaction pattern helps in managing large amounts of content within a limited space by providing a clean and organized interface. By clicking on the headers, users can reveal or conceal the associated content panels, enhancing user experience through intuitive design.
